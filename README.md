I have been working in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP and Computer Vision-based models. A data scientist with more than 1 year of experience. Expertise in model development to deployment lifecycle. I provide required solutions to business problems by working on its statistical and analytical approach. </b>
</br>

<h2><b>ML and DL Projects:</b></h2>
Completed regression, classification and clustering projects in Python using Scikit-Learn. Codes are 
available here on GitHub.<br>
Implemented CNN on images. Good knowledge of Image classification and Detection.<br>

<h2><b>Iot based Fleet monitoring, tracking and incident reporting system (FYP): </b></h2>
Developed a plug and play device that will plug into the vehicles and will help companies to monitor and track the vehicles in Real time</br>
Developed a web application and all the events will be logged and generated for the admin on the dashboard. </br>
If any incident occurs, automatically be detected by this device and send an alert notification and vehicle's location to the admin portal and the nearby rescue authorities.</br>
Because of the real-time tracking the rescue authorities will be able to reach in time and the victims get rescued well and also reduce the risk of death caused by road incidents.</br>
